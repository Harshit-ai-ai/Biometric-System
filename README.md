## Architecture Overview

This system introduces a continuous spatial-temporal methodology for strict physical attendance tracking in large-scale educational institutions (Universities, College Campuses). Built to scale to **10,000+ students**, we replace static snapshot-based facial recognition with a multi-layered, continuously accumulating presence engine that integrates ten distinct technical innovations into a single, edge-optimized pipeline.

The core pipeline operates asynchronously using ThreadPool concurrency: a video frame is captured, validated against environmental sensors, passed through a YOLOv8 body-detection liveness gate, processed by a facial recognition layer, fused with iris and voice biometric signals via a Kalman filter, and finally credited to an Accumulated Active Presence (AAP) counter. Every state change is logged to a tamper-evident blockchain audit trail and accompanied by a zero-knowledge proof.

## Production Deployment Guide (Vercel + Cloud Docker)

Because the continuous vision engine requires heavy native C++ dependencies (`libgl1-mesa-glx`, `cmake`, `dlib`) and significant RAM for YOLOv8 inference, it is architected for a split deployment.

### 1. Deploy Frontend (Vercel)
The React/Vite frontend is pre-configured with a `vercel.json` for React Router and utilizes environment variables for dynamic API mapping.
1. Create a project in Vercel and link your GitHub repository.
2. Set the Root Directory to `smart-classroom/frontend`.
3. Under Environment Variables, add:
   * `VITE_API_URL` = `https://your-backend.onrender.com`
   * `VITE_WS_URL` = `wss://your-backend.onrender.com/ws/dashboard`
4. Click **Deploy**.

### 2. Deploy Backend (Render / Railway / AWS ECS)
The backend includes a highly optimized Ubuntu-based `Dockerfile` that automatically handles the C++ toolchains and AI model compilations.
1. Connect your repository to a PaaS like Render (Web Service) or Railway.
2. Select **Docker** as the runtime environment.
3. Set the Root Directory to `smart-classroom/backend`.
4. Ensure the instance has at least **1GB - 2GB RAM** to handle YOLO inference without out-of-memory (OOM) errors.
5. Deploy. The FastAPI server will automatically expose port `8000` via Uvicorn.

### 3. Hardware Deployment Topologies (24x7x365 Operations)
Because this system is engineered for continuous 24x7 operation across a large university campus rather than a standalone student project, the hardware rollout is highly flexible to accommodate university firewalls. The platform supports three primary hardware architectures:

#### Topology A: Centralized NVR IT Server (Recommended for Campuses)
Instead of installing hardware in every room, all classroom CCTV RTSP feeds are routed back to the university's centralized IT server room. A single, powerful instance of the `cctv_edge_client.py` runs on the central server, concurrently ingesting all 50+ classroom streams, processing the frames, and securely transmitting the biometrics over HTTPS to the Render backend.

```mermaid

```

#### Topology B: Direct VPN / VPC Tunnel
If the university IT department provisions a secure Site-to-Site VPN or IP Whitelist, the Render Cloud backend can bypass the university firewall directly. The cloud engine connects natively to `rtsp://<internal-camera-ip>` without any intermediary hardware.

    style Cloud fill:#7f1d1d,stroke:#f87171,color:#fee2e2
```

#### Topology C: Local Classroom Edge Gateways
For decentralized networks (or older buildings without centralized IT wiring), a low-cost Edge Node (e.g., Raspberry Pi 5, Intel NUC) is installed in the AV rack of each physical classroom. It runs the Edge Client as a resilient `systemd` service, silently bridging the gap between the local CCTV camera and the external cloud API.

## Enterprise Dashboard & Reporting

The system provides a comprehensive React-based UI for university administrators, professors, and students. It is heavily optimized to handle large datasets and features a fully integrated API security layer.

### 1. Secure Faculty Authentication
Access to the CSTPE engine is restricted via an Enterprise Login Portal. Faculty must authenticate using a **MAHE Authorized ID** to unlock the dashboard.
![Faculty Authentication](smart-classroom/docs/screenshots/login.png)

### 2. Central Administrator Dashboard
The live tracking engine processes camera streams without blocking the asynchronous web server. Teachers can visually track Accumulated Active Presence (AAP) progression and finalize daily reports.
![Administrator Dashboard](smart-classroom/docs/screenshots/dashboard.png)

### 3. High-Res CCTV Edge Gateway
The system supports wall-mounted 1080p/4K CCTV IP cameras out of the box via an **Edge Gateway Script**. The dashboard dynamically switches between local laptop tracking and passive cloud CCTV monitoring.
![Live CCTV Integration](smart-classroom/docs/screenshots/camera.png)

### 4. Direct Student Enrollment
Administrators can register new students directly into the deep learning database using the UI. The system extracts facial encodings securely without requiring backend scripts.
![Student Enrollment](smart-classroom/docs/screenshots/enrollment.png)

### 5. Student Data Management (10k+ Scale)
A dedicated lookup portal allows administrators or students to instantly pull historical attendance records across the entire semester.
![Student Profile Lookup](smart-classroom/docs/screenshots/students.png)

### 6. Multi-Sheet Excel Export Engine
Designed for university registrars, the system generates comprehensive official `.xlsx` reports containing:
1.  **Today's Session:** Active metrics for the current class.
2.  **Full Attendance History:** Granular chronological logs.
3.  **Per-Student Summaries:** Aggregates total classes, attendance rate %, and average biometric certainty scores.
4.  **Daily Class Summaries:** High-level university metrics.
5.  **Blockchain Audit Trail:** The immutable hash-chain.

## Novel Modules

Here is a detailed visual breakdown of how each patented feature is practically applied in the system:

| Module | Feature | Technical Implementation & Application |
|--------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| **1. Two-Stage YOLO Liveness** | Anti-spoofing body-gated face detection | **Application:** YOLOv8n first detects a human person and checks aspect-ratio constraints. A face is only recognized if it is dimensionally bound *inside* a verified human torso. |
| **2. Adaptive Gap Threshold** | Entropy-driven temporal sensitivity | **Application:** Adjusts the "leave gap" dynamically. MediaPipe Pose extracts 33 body keypoints. A sliding-window entropy computation maps movement patterns to per-student dynamic gap thresholds. |
| **3. Model Hash Attestation** | Tamper-proof model loading | **Application:** SHA-256 cryptographic hashes of all model weights (e.g., `yolov8n.pt`, `yolov8n.onnx`) are verified at startup against a sealed registry. |
| **4. Zero-Knowledge Proofs** | Privacy-preserving presence verification | **Application:** A Pedersen commitment scheme generates ZK proofs for each 5-second presence window. |
| **5. Edge-Only Inference** | Hardware camera deployment | **Application:** Downscales inputs to 640px and natively loads ONNX quantized models via OpenCV/ONNXRuntime for deployment on Jetson Nanos. |
| **6. Policy-as-Code DSL** | Runtime-configurable attendance rules | **Application:** A domain-specific language parser loads `policy.dsl` at startup, enabling administrators to hot-reload time thresholds without restarting servers. |
| **7. Federated Learning** | On-device anti-spoof improvement | **Application:** Edge devices locally train a logistic classifier on genuine/spoof detections and upload only weight deltas. |
| **8. Blockchain Audit Log** | Immutable event ledger | **Application:** An append-only SHA-256 hash-chain records every state change. Any retrospective tampering breaks the chain. |
| **9. Environmental Gating** | Context-aware validation | **Application:** Ambient light (lux) and temperature (Celsius) sensor readings gate AAP accumulation. |
| **10. Session Recovery** | Biometric continuity after gaps | **Application:** Re-links post-gap detections to existing sessions using cosine similarity of stored face embeddings. |

## Enterprise Compliance & Data Privacy (FERPA / GDPR)

A critical requirement for university deployment is strict adherence to student data privacy laws (FERPA in the US, GDPR in Europe). The CSTPE architecture enforces privacy by design:
1. **No Raw Image Retention:** The edge gateways and cloud backend **never save raw images** of students. Video frames are held in volatile RAM for milliseconds, converted into irreversible 128-dimensional numerical vectors (embeddings), and immediately discarded.
2. **AES-256 Cryptographic Storage:** The `encodings.pkl` database only stores mathematical vectors that are fundamentally encrypted at rest using AES-256 (`cryptography.fernet`). Even if the physical server is stolen, it is impossible to read or reverse-engineer a student's face.
3. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Attendance reports generated for the university registrar use ZK-Pedersen commitments, proving a student was present for the required duration without exposing the granular, second-by-second tracking logs.

---

## DDoS & Network Hardening

To ensure the system remains highly available and impenetrable to outside attacks:
1. **SlowAPI Rate Limiting:** All endpoints are mathematically throttled to prevent brute-force and DDoS attacks (e.g., the biometric enrollment API is hard-limited to 10 requests/minute per IP).
2. **Strict CORS Verification:** The backend explicitly rejects network traffic from random origins or external scripts, restricting API access exclusively to the official university dashboard URL.

---

## Disaster Recovery & Backup Strategy

For a 24x7x365 production system, data loss is unacceptable.
1. **Persistent Cloud Volumes:** The SQLite `attendance.db` and biometric databases are strictly routed to a persistent `/data` volume mount on Render, ensuring data survives container restarts and OS patching.
2. **Automated S3 Snapshots:** The system is architected to support automated CRON jobs that snapshot the SQLite database to an AWS S3 bucket daily at 03:00 AM.
3. **Edge Resilience:** If the university network drops, the `cctv_edge_client.py` utilizes a local SQLite write-ahead queue to buffer attendance events locally. When the internet is restored, it bulk-syncs the buffered events to the cloud.
